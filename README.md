# Human Emotion Detector ðŸ˜Š

This repository contains a model for detecting human emotions from images with high accuracy.

### Key Features:
- Utilizes **PyTorch** for deep learning model implementation.
- Employs a **pretrained EfficientNet_B0** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for emotion classification. For more details on the model, refer to the [EfficientNet_B0 documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/generated/torchvision.models.efficientnet_b0.html).
